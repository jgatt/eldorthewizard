Eldor The Wizard
==============

Welcome to Eldor the Wizard's Colourful Adventure!

As I am sure you will notice when you first start up the game, this is no mere normal helicopter game!  In fact you play as a wizard (with such a fashionable top hat too) who is determined to bring some colour to the drab world in which he resides.

Full Control List:

	W –     Up
	A –     Left
	S –     Down
	D –     Right
	Space – Bomb
	F –     Pause
	H –     Access High Scores
	M –     Toggle Wizard Mode
  
  Note: If you get sick of all the colours that spawn with Eldor click the 'm' key, as that will switch you from 'wizard' mode to 'normal'   mode. 'Normal' mode is the same just lacking the particles that spawn at your position.
  
  Second Note:  This is a terrible 'helicopter' styled game that I had to make for my User Interfaces course at the University of Waterloo.
